# Exercise 1 : What are you learning ?
# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning in this course.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

# üåü Exercise 2: What‚Äôs your favorite book ?
# Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter called title.
# The function should print a message, such as "One of my favorite books is <title>".
# For example: ‚ÄúOne of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland‚Äù
# Call the function, make sure to include a book title as an argument when calling the function.

# üåü Exercise 3 : Some Geography
# Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country as parameters.
# The function should print a simple sentence, such as "<city> is in <country>".
# For example ‚ÄúReykjavik is in Iceland‚Äù
# Give the country parameter a default value.
# Call your function.

# Exercise 4 : Random
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100. Use the random module.
# Compare the two numbers, if it‚Äôs the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

#NOTE TO CHECKER: WE DIDN'T LEARN RANDOM MODULE, WHY IS THERE SUCH EXERCISE?

# üåü Exercise 5 : Let‚Äôs create some personalized shirts !
# Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt.
# The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it, such as "The size of the shirt is <size> and the text is <text>"

# üåü Exercise 6 : Magicians ‚Ä¶
# Using this list of magician‚Äôs names

# Create a function called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the list.
def show_magicians():

# üåü Exercise 7 : Temperature Advice
# Create a function called get_random_temp().
# This function should return an integer between -10 and 40 degrees (Celsius), selected at random.
# Test your function to make sure it generates expected results.

def get_random_temp():

    return random_temp_chosen
    # NOTE TO MYSELF - you can't put any code after return statement, return includes exiting the function
print(get_random_temp())


# Create a function called main().
# Inside this function, call get_random_temp() to get a temperature, and store its value in a variable.
# Inform the user of the temperature in a friendly message, eg. ‚ÄúThe temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.‚Äù

def main():

# between zero and 16 (eg. ‚ÄúQuite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat‚Äù)
# between 16 and 23
# between 24 and 32
# between 32 and 40

        print("Cool weather today.")
    else:
        print("Perfect weather today, or is it too hot for you")

main()


# Change the get_random_temp() function:
# Add a parameter to the function, named ‚Äòseason‚Äô.

# Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‚Äòwinter‚Äô, temperatures should only fall between -10 and 16.
# Now that we‚Äôve changed get_random_temp(), let‚Äôs change the main() function:
# Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. Ask the user to type in a season - ‚Äòsummer‚Äô, ‚Äòautumn‚Äô (you can use ‚Äòfall‚Äô if you prefer), ‚Äòwinter‚Äô, or ‚Äòspring‚Äô.
# Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().

#NOTE TO CHECKER - not sure why is this producing no result?


# Bonus: Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.
# Bonus: Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.
