# user's word : "ttiiitllleeee" âžž "title"

#             SET - {"ppoeemm"} -> "oemp", "oepm"... sets are not ordered
#             LIST - [] -> loop through chars in word and check if character is inside
#                           the list - if it is DONT add it to the list
#                           otherwise add it to the list
#                           -> ["p","o","e","m"] ... wont work since the characters can
#                           repeat themselves like it title (2 t's)
