# üåü Exercise 1 : Pets
# Using this code:
class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'


# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.

all_cats = [cat1, cat2, cat3]   
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.
sara_pets.walk()    


# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
    # bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
    # run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
    # fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. 
    #   This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.
class Dog():
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight

dog3 = Dog("Whiskers", 1, 10)
# Test the methods
print(dog1.bark())
print(dog2.run_speed())
print(dog1.fight(dog2))

# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# NOTE TO CHECKER - DANIEL TOLD US TO SKIP EXERCISE WITH MODULE SINCE WE DIDN'T COVER IT

# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.







# Exercise 4 : Family
# Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:
# members: list of dictionaries
# last_name : (string)

# Implement the following methods:

# born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don‚Äôt forget to print a message congratulating the family.
# is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
# family_presentation: a method that prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details.

# Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
# This is no random family they are an incredible family, therefore the members attributes, will be a list of dictionaries containing the additional keys : power and incredible_name. (See Point 4)
# Add a method called use_power, this method should print the power of a member only if they are over 18 years old. If not raise an exception (look up exceptions) which stated they are not over 18 years old.
# Add a method called incredible_presentation which :
# Print a sentence like ‚Äú*Here is our powerful family **‚Äù
# Prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details (ie. use the super() function, to call the family_presentation method)
